        Represents the intersection of two nodes
       A Chord allows indexed access to the nodes, which are always sorted.
       While the implementation is similar to Span, conceptually they are
         different.  A Chord is the intersection of two nodes.  A span is the
         segment(s) between two or more nodes.

        Represents a segment of a planar diagram between nodes.
       An ordered pair of nodes - the end points of the span
       While the implementation is similar to Chord, conceptually they are
         different.  A Chord is the intersection of two nodes.  A Span is the
         segment(s) between two or more nodes.
    Return remaining portions(s) of self after removing span
           Always returns a span list.  Removing the middle of an existing span
             results in two distinct spans
           Endpoint nodes of subtracted span are not removed

           Args:
               span: Segment to remove from self
           Returns:
               Returns a list of 1 or 2 remaining spans
           Raises:
               None

       Size is the number of endpoints in the diagram

       Diagram cannot be drawn if any chord has even length
       Chord length is even if both endpoints are even or both are odd

       i.e. if three cords form an adjacency loop - our put another way:
       each chord endpoint is adjacent to another chord's endpoint to form a
       closed loop containing three chords.Generate extension chords to test in each diagram
       Extensions use only odd endpoints
       Diagram will use only even endpoints - ensures no collisions

Status and errors are printed to stderr.

Note: A header line is printed before any data.

-k: When specified, diagrams will be printed as diagram keys.
    Otherwise, the string version of the diagram is printed.
